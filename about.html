                    <h3>A Glimpse Into The Past</h3>
                    <p>The Apostolic Church of St. Thomas Christians traces its origin back to
                        the preaching of St. Thomas, the Apostle who arrived on the Coast of Kerala in
                        AD 52. The Church grew up on the solid apostolic foundation. In the course of
                        history this Church entered into hierarchical relationship with the East Syrian
                        Church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and became an autonomous Metropolitan See
                        under the East Syrian Patriarch who was in communion with the Apostolic
                        See of Rome. The office of the Metropolitan was entitled 'the Metropolitan and
                        Gate of All India'. The administrative head of the Church was the Archdeacon
                        and was called The 'Archdeacon of All India'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Portuguese missionaries who arrived in the 16 century could not
                      decipher the liturgical traditions and the mode of governance of this Church.
                      They took various measures to latinize our ancient rite. When the domination
                      of the Portuguese missionaries became unbearable, the Thomas Christians
                      made a public protest against their rule in 1653, which became known in
                      history as <span class="fst-italic" style="font-weight: 700;"> Coonan Cross Oath (കൂനൻ ക്രൂശ് സത്യം) </span>. Gradually, there occurred
                      divisions in the church and in the course of time a fraction of the Thomas
                      Christians adopted the faith of the Antiochian Jacobite Church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      later, a small portion among them became reunited to Catholic faith
                      and they now form the Syro Malankara Church. The majority of the Thomas
                      Christians who always remained faithful to the Catholic faith are the present
                      Syro Malabar Church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The modern history of the Church of the Catholic Thomas Christians
                      renamed as the Syro Malabar Church began with the erection of two Vicariates
                      in 1887.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Pope Leo XIII of happy memory by his Bull Quod Jam Pridem dated
                      May 20, 1887 established two Vicariates Apostolic - Kottayam and Thrichur -
                      exclusively for the Syro Malabarians and Dr. Charles Lavigne SJ and Dr. Adolph
                      Medlycott respectively were appointed the Vicars Apostolic respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With the permission of the Holy See, Mar Charles Lavigne changed
                      his residence from Kottayam to Changanacherry in 1891. The strong Catholic
                      presence at Changanacherry and the newly built beautiful church were the
                      main attractions for Mar Lavigne to prefer Changanacherry as his residence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The same Pope reorganized the existing Vicariates by the Apostolic
                        Bull Quae Rei Sacrae dated July 28, 1896 establishing a new Vicariate,
                        Ernakulam, with territories carved out from the two existing Vicariates
                        (Pallippuram, Edappally and Arakuzha divisions from Kottayam Vicariate).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      having estabilshed the Head Quarters in Changanacherry the
                      Vicariate of Kottayam was renamed Changanacherry. Indigenous bishops
                      were appointed Vicars Apostolic to the new Sees. They were Mar Mathew
                      Makkil for Changanacherry, Mar Louis Pazheparambil (from Changanacherry
                      Vicariate) for Ernakulam and Mar John Menacherry for Thrichur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A new Vicariate of Kottayam was constituted in 1911 exclusively for
                      the Suddists and Mar Mathew Makkil was transferred to Kottayam as the
                      Vicar Apostolic of Suddists and Mar Thomas Kurialacherry was appointed
                      the Vicar Apostolic of Changanacherry. The Syro Malabar Hierarchy was
                      established on December 21, 1923 by the Apostolic Bull Romani Pontifices of
                      Pope Pius XI, with Ernakulam as the Metropolitan See and the Eparchies of
                      Thrichur, Changanacherry and Kottayam as its suffragans thereby constituting
                      the first Syro Malabar Province. Mar Thomas Kurialacherry was called to
                      eternal reward in 1925 and Mar James Kalacherry succeeded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On July 25, 1950 the Eparchy of Changanacherry was bifurcated by
                      the Apostolic Bull Quo Ecclesiarum of Pope Pius XII and the new Eparchy
                      of Palai was created. Mar Mathew Kavukatt was appointed the bishop of
                      Changanacherry as the successor of Mar Kalacherry in 1950.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Holy See, impressed by the wonderful progress achieved by the
                      Syro Malabarians, extended the hitherto held boundaries of Changanacherry
                      to the areas south of river Pamba, up to (including) Kanyakumari, by the
                      Bull Multorum Fidelium of Pope Pius XII, dated April 29, 1955. Similarly, the
                      boundary of the Church in the North was extended beyond Bharathapuzha by
                      another Apostolic Bull.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Changanacherry was raised to the status of an Archeparchy on July
                        26, 1956 by Pope Pius XII constituting the second province in the Syro
                        Malabar Church and Kottayam and Pala became its suffragans. The Apostolic
                        Constitution Regnum Caelorum of November 26, 1959 of Pope John XXIII
                        gave effect to this decision of Pope Pius XII. Mar Mathew Kavukatt served the
                        Archeparchy as the Metropolitan Archbishop until 1969 and was succeeded
                        by Archbishop Mar Antony Padiyara in 1970.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 1975 the missionary work of three (now five) civil districts of
                      the Latin Archdiocese of Agra in the State of Uttar Pradesh was taken up
                      completely by the Archeparchy of Changanacherry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Archeparchy was again divided on February 26, 1977 by the
                      Bull Nos Beati Petri of Pope Paul VI and the new Eparchy of Kanjirappally
                      was set up comprising parts of the Civil districts of Kottayam, Idukki and
                      Pathanamthitta. Mar Joseph Powathil was appointed the first bishop of the
                      eparchy of Kanjirappally. Mar Joseph Powathil was appointed Metropolitan
                      Archbishop of Changanacherry in 1985, when Archbishop Mar Antony Padiyara
                      was transferred to Ernakulam as its Metropolitan Archbishop. Archbishop Mar
                      Joseph Powathil took charge of the Archeparchy on 17 January 1986.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Archeparchy was divided a fifth time when its Kanyakumari
                      Mission was elevated to the status of a new Eparchy by the Bull Apud
                      Indorum Gentes of St. John Paul II, dated December 18, 1996. The formal
                      inauguration of the new eparchy of Thuckalay and the Episcopal Ordination of
                      Mar George Alencherry as its first Bishop took place on February 2, 1997.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Archbishop Mar Joseph Powathil served the Archeparchy until his
                      retirement in 2007 and Mar Joseph Perumthottam was appointed on January
                      20, 2007 as the new Metropolitan Archbishop of Changanacherry and was
                      installed on March 19, 2007. The Archeparchy of Changanacherry now
                      comprises the Civil districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta,
                      Alappuzha and Kottayam in Kerala with Palai, Kanjirapally and Thuckalay as
                      its suffragans. The most important ecclesial event of this period was the
                      canonization of Blessed Sr. Alphonsa FCC in 2008 by His Holiness Pope Benedict
                      XVI as the first woman Saint of India. Appointment of a Syncellus for the
                      Southern region, erection of four more Foranes (Kudamaloor, Thrickodithanam,
                      Kollam - Ayoor, Thuruthy) and the formation of forane councils are some of the
                      noteworthy pastoral initiatives during these years.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Pastoral Ministry at Present</h5>
                    <p>
                      The pastoral ministry in the Archeparchy is organized centered on ten
                      areas, namely. <span class="fst-italic" style="font-weight: 700;"> കുടുംബം, കൂട്ടായ്മ, ആതുരസേവനം
                      സാമൂഹികക്ഷേമം, ദൈവാരാധന, പ്രേഷിതഭൗത്യം, വിദ്യാഭ്യാസം, വിശ്വാസപരിശീലനം, പരിസ്ഥിതി സംരക്ഷണം, പ്രവാസി ക്ഷേമം. </span>
                      The activities are organized and co ordinated under different departments
                      headed by priests and some laymen. The Proto Syncellus and the Syncelli
                      supervise the whole activities in the respective areas assigned to them. There
                      are regular gatherings of the Departmental Heads and the Archeparchial Curia members with the Metropolitan Archbishop to share and evaluate the various
                      pastoral activities. The curia meetings are held twice in a week to discuss
                      and decide day to day pastoral affairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The post centenary Silver Jubilee (125) of the Archeparchy was a major
                      event which was celebrated in 2012 with a triennial intensive preparation.
                      The three year preparation was arranged as the Year of Priests (2009-2010),
                      Year of the Consecrated (2010-2011) and the Year of the Laity (2011-2012)
                      which coincided with the Jubilee year.
                                          </p>
                    <p>
                      The celebration was officially inaugurated by Archbishop Salvatore
                      Pennachio, the Apostolic Nuncio of India on May 19, 2011. On June 11,
                      2011 the Feast of Pentecost, parish level and family level inaugurations of the
                      Jubilee Year were held. Apart from the parish and forane level programmes
                      there were around 10 different gatherings in the Archeparchial level in which
                      the people from different spheres of life came together. The most important
                      among these gatherings was the meeting of about 5000 representatives from
                      the parishes and other institutions which was held on January 14, 2012. The
                      chief guests of the programme were His Eminence Leonardo Cardinal Sandri,

                      establishing an Eparchial Youth Movement called Yuvadeepti. In course of time,

                      True to his motto, the ministry of Mar Joseph Powathil as bishop and Archbishop
                      has been one of dedication and commitment to 'Truth and Charity'. Mar Joseph
                      Powathil’s ministry transcends the bounds of the Archeparchy and the people
                      entrusted to his care. He served as President of CBCI (1994-1998), Chairman
                      of KCBC (1993-1996) & Chairman of Education Commission of CBCI. He was

                      <p>The Syro Malabar Church, in which he was born and brought up, has
                      always been kept close to his heart. He has always been a devoted son of this
                      Church, and therefore always on the forefront in the struggles for the restoration
                      of its legitimate rights and its identity as an Individual Church.</p>
                      <p>e did a great deal to promote formation based on this identity to
                      priests, religious and the laity (Oriental Study Forum, Dukrana, Christian Orient,
                      Missionary Orientation Centre (MOC), Amala Theological College, Marthoma
                      Vidyanikethan, Zion Retreat Centre etc., He also founded an Eastern Monastic
                      Congregation - Sisters of St. Thomas (SST - Marthoma Sahodarikal (MTS)).
                      The new Priests’ Home stands out as a symbol of his care and concern for the
                      elderly and sick priests.</p>
                      <p>Archbishop Joseph Powathil has been a staunch defender of the
                      teachings of the Magisterium. His concern for the poor, the underprivileged
                      and the marginalized was such that he initiated a number of schemes for
                      their development. Malanad Development Society (MDS - 1977) in Eparchy
                      of Kanjirappally and the various projects of the Changanacherry Social Service
                      Society (CHASS) bear ample testimony to this. Worthy of special mentions are
                      the foundation of Blessed Alphonsa Snehanivas for street children and Blessed
                      Alphonsa Centre (Abhaya Bhavan) for the terminally ill.</p>
                      <p>ar Joseph Powathil’s pastoral outlook is broad and encompasses
                      the non Catholics and even the non Christians. He is well known in the
                      ecumenical movement (Inter Church Council, Nilackal Ecumenical Trust) and
                      the Church’s fellowship with followers of the other religions. New centres
                      or parishes have been established in the extended territory (home mission)
                      namely, at Chengannur, Mavelikkara, Adoor, Kollam, Niranam, Pathanapuram,
                      Kottarakkara, Karavaloor etc. The source of Mar Joseph Powathil’s sense of
                      mission and dedication is undoubtedly his commitment to Truth and Charity,
                      enriched by his solid faith and life in the Spirit. Considering the valuable
                      contributions of Mar Joseph Powathil to the Syro Malabar Church, he was
                      awarded Doctorate in Theology from Paurastya Vidyapitham, Vadavathoor in
                      the year 2020.</p>
